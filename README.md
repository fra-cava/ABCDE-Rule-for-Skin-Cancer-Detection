# ABCDE-Rule-for-Skin-Cancer-Detection
The ABCDE method is a guideline used to evaluate skin lesions, particularly to identify potential melanomas. Each letter represents a key feature to assess:
A – Asymmetry: One half of the lesion does not match the other half in shape or color.
B – Border: The edges of the lesion are irregular, blurred, or jagged.
C – Color: The lesion shows multiple colors, such as shades of brown, black, red, white, or blue.
D – Diameter: The lesion is larger than 6 mm (about the size of a pencil eraser), although melanomas can be smaller.
E – Evolving: The lesion changes in size, shape, color, or symptoms (e.g., bleeding, itching) over time.
This method helps clinicians and patients recognize early warning signs of malignant skin lesions, promoting timely medical evaluation and treatment.
